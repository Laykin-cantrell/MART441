  <h3>About Me!</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is Laykin Cantrell! I am a junior majoring in Media Arts. I am expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2027. I transferred frommy local community college, 
  Fort Peck Community College, on the Fort Peck Assiniboine & Sioux Reservation. I graduated as the valedictorian with an Associate of Applied Science in Communication Technology,
  along with two certificates in Digital Technology and Geographic Information Systems. I graduated from high school in May 2022 and went straight to the
  University of Montana, majoring in Physics/Astronomy. I had a rough time with the math professor there, which led me to change my degree to Media Arts. I have
  always been fascinated with editing, coding, animation, web design, photography, and creating games, but was told growing up that I should pick a degree that would get
  me a stable job, which is why I chose a STEM degree. After switching my degree, I had to withdraw from the University due to mental health. I took the rest of that 
  spring semester off and then enrolled in my local community college. My main instructor was very supportive and helped me get my passion back for media arts and encouraged
  me to get my bachelor's in Media Arts. I am really glad I listened to her because now I get to take all these amazing Media Arts courses offered by the University of Montana.</p>

  <h3>Interests/memory</h3>
  <p>Growing up, my siblings and I were only connected through games due to our age gaps. We only played Mario games, like Mario Party, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros., and Super Mario Bros. Wii/U.
  I really do cherish those memories as I get older. My favorite memory of playing a game is when we played Mario Party 2. I was in last place with zero stars and only ten coins on the last turn. I landed on Chance Times
  and was able to swap stars with my older brother, who was in first place with five stars. He was so mad that he had to step out of the living room. I ended up winning, and I rubbed it in his face for a long time; he still 
  makes sure I don't win Mario Party ever again. Due to all of the great memories I have as a kid playing games, I would love to create a game where kids could play with their family or friends, be competitive, and create
  memories with each other. </p>
